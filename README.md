üëã Hello! This time, I have created a Black Jack card game using JavaFx! 
‚ô£ For anyone who does not know how Black Jack works, the objective of the game is to reach as close of a score to 21 without exceeding it. 
‚ô•Ô∏è Your main objective as a player is to beat other players and the dealer.
‚ô¶Ô∏è In my application, the game will only be played between a cpu, which is the dealer, and the player, which is you the user.
To run this code, just simply copy and paste the code into a programming software compatible with Java and run the BlackJack file in the terminal!
